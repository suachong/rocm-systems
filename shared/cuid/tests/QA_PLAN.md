# CUID QA

Scope: `shared/cuid` (library) and the CUID API, bindings and CLI in
`projects/amdsmi`. The kernel's only CUID test is a KUnit known-answer test in
amdgpu.

## Test wrappers and hardware gaps

CTest discovers three wrappers: `cuid_unprivileged_tests`,
`cuid_privileged_tests` and `cuid_regression_tests`. The last runs all
`cuidtst.*` cases; some skip without root. Read skip reasons on each run: a
green CTest result alone does not establish privileged or hardware coverage.

**No partition-capable GPU has run this qualification.** Partition and VF unit
tests use fixtures; they do not establish CPX/DPX or guest behavior on hardware.

## Lookup configurations

* **Tier 1:** the driver publishes CUIDs. amd-smi reports the derived value
  verbatim with source `DRIVER`, for root and ordinary users alike. A driver
  that publishes `cuid_primary` and `cuid_unit_id` but no `cuid_derived`
  leaves a whole GPU keyed like a CPU and a partition without a CUID.
* **Tier 2:** the driver publishes nothing. A whole GPU gets a temporary CUID
  with source `LIBRARY`; a partition gets none.

CPU, NIC, NPU and Platform CUIDs are derived with the node key for root when
one exists (any amdgpu `cuid_seed`, else the `AmdCuidKey` UEFI variable) and
are temporary otherwise.

| Axis | Cases to distinguish |
|---|---|
| Privilege | Root and ordinary user; primary identity is privileged |
| Driver support | CUID attributes present and absent |
| Node key | None, driver-generated (`unprovisioned`), administrator-set (`provisioned`), only in efivarfs |
| efivarfs | Creates `AmdCuidKey` 0600, or lists it 0644 and immutable |
| Firmware identity | Adopted system UUID and constructed Platform identity |
| Hardware | Whole GPU, no readable serial, spatial partition, SR-IOV VF |

A constructed primary encodes component identity. An adopted firmware primary
is opaque and need not be UUIDv8. Canonical derived CUIDs depend on the node
key; auxiliary values use the machine-id application key (K_app) and do not
change on node re-key. Do not decode adopted UUIDs as constructed payloads or
expect every derived value to move after provisioning.

## Builds

Run from the repository root. Use an unused build directory; an installed
`/opt/rocm` package can shadow in-tree work.

```sh
W=$(mktemp -d)
cmake -S shared/cuid -B "$W/build-cuid" -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=ON \
  -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$W/install-cuid"
cmake --build "$W/build-cuid" --parallel 8

cmake -S projects/amdsmi -B "$W/build-amdsmi" -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_CUID=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=ON \
  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DENABLE_ESMI_LIB=OFF \
  -DBUILD_CLI=OFF -DBUILD_WRAPPER=OFF \
  -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_amdcuid=ON \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$W/install-amdsmi"
cmake --build "$W/build-amdsmi" --parallel 8
```

Disabling package discovery forces the in-tree CUID build. A CLI/package build
needs its corresponding options.

Two additional build configurations need separate checks:

* **Installed CUID:** install the library component to a private prefix, then
  configure amd-smi with `AMDCUID_HINT_DIR` pointing there and without disabling
  package discovery. Confirm the configure log selected that package.
* **CUID disabled:** configure with `BUILD_CUID=OFF`. Confirm the same exported
  amd-smi ABI and `NOT_SUPPORTED` from the CUID entry points.

`BUILD_CUID=AUTO` uses an installed package when found, otherwise the sibling
source tree. `ON` fails if neither is available; `AUTO` warns and disables CUID.
`AMDSMI_CUID_TEST_SYSFS_OVERRIDE=ON` enables an amd-smi provenance test seam;
keep it out of shipped builds. It does not relocate libamdcuid's hardware reads.

## Running tests safely

Set `AMDCUID_VECTORS_PATH` to this checkout's
`shared/cuid/tests/vectors/cuid_vectors.txt` when comparing separately built
binaries.

```sh
export AMDCUID_VECTORS_PATH="$PWD/shared/cuid/tests/vectors/cuid_vectors.txt"
"$W/build-cuid/tests/amdcuid_test"
ctest --test-dir "$W/build-cuid" --output-on-failure -V
"$W/build-amdsmi/tests/amd_smi_test/amdsmitst" \
  --gtest_filter='*Cuid*:*CUID*:*cuid*'
python3 -m pytest projects/amdsmi/tests/python/unit/gpu/test_cli_cuid_seed.py -q
```

**Setting the key writes firmware.** A `cuid_seed` write makes amdgpu rewrite
the `AmdCuidKey` UEFI variable, and without amdgpu `amdcuid_set_hash_key()` writes it directly.
On the host, only `cuidtstPrivileged.HMAC` sets a key, and only with
`AMDCUID_TEST_ALLOW_SET_KEY=1`; run it only on a host whose key may change.
`cuid_gpu_paths` also sets keys (the rotate probe and the efivarfs fallback),
but only into its fixture `/sys` inside a private mount namespace.

`AMDCUID_BUILD_LIFECYCLE_TESTS=ON` adds `cuid_gpu_paths`, which runs GPU
discovery against a synthetic `/sys` in a private mount namespace as root. Its
build directory must be outside `/tmp`, which the namespace replaces. Run it
with `sudo ctest --test-dir <build> -R cuid_gpu_paths --output-on-failure`.
Besides GPU path resolution it covers node-key loading (`cuid_seed` over
`AmdCuidKey`, a malformed variable, the provisioned flag), the
`amdcuid_set_hash_key()` efivarfs fallback, a non-AMD display device, and a
whole GPU before and after the driver publishes `cuid_derived`. A fixture that
opts in also discovers a CPU (from the host's `/proc/cpuinfo`), a NIC and the
Platform against synthetic SMBIOS and PCI data.

For tier 2 use a host without CUID support, or a separately authorized
maintenance run with `amdgpu.cuid=0` set at module load. Verify attributes are
absent. Loading/unloading a GPU driver is not a prerequisite
for the fixture tests and must not be done on a host with a pending partition
change without a hardware-specific plan.

## Assertions and gaps

* `ConformanceVectors` consumes all 39 rows and records
  `conformance_vectors=39` in GTest XML. Run
  `python3 shared/cuid/tests/vectors/cuid_vectors.py --check` too. That checks
  the local table against its generator. This table is the source of truth;
  the kernel's KUnit test asserts a subset of its rows, and nothing checks that
  subset against it automatically. Table SHA-256:
  `b339274b8be91a546c474391d72c41e695f4b522c24ca6e0a56b141e377198c4`.
* UnitID is zero for a whole component. A GPU partition's is its XCC range,
  `(xcc_count << 6) | first_xcc`, published by the driver; an SR-IOV VF's is
  its one-based index. Values above `0x1fff` are refused, not masked. The suite checks unchanged output on refusal
  and propagation through GPU reconstruction.
* Compare every driver-published GPU derived CUID against both libamdcuid and
  amd-smi. A partition must report its own driver value or no value, never its
  parent's, except that amd-smi reports the whole GPU's for the one partition
  of a GPU in SPX that has none. Hardware qualification remains outstanding.
* Handle tests require success for discovered devices and reject absent ones.
  `ColdLookupEnvironment` starts before the test fixtures enumerate, but later
  calls in that environment share the manager warmed by the first lookup; it
  does not independently cold-start each API.
* CLI checks: seed metadata once per invocation; derived/primary/type/auxiliary/
  source fields per GPU; primary only when explicitly requested and permitted;
  consistent JSON/CSV field names. Python seed tests simulate provisioning and
  do not establish real driver behavior.
* `AmdCuidKey` is read end to end only from a fixture file in
  `cuid_gpu_paths`; no harness reads one a real driver created in efivarfs.
* GPU discovery lists AMD GPUs (Vendor ID `0x1002`) only. `cuid_gpu_paths`
  checks this with a synthetic `0x1a03` display device; on a host with a BMC
  display device, `amdcuid_get_all_handles()` must not return it either.

## Packaging checks still required for release

Check artifacts from each intended channel: amd-smi deb/rpm, its manylinux
wheel, and TheRock packages/wheels. A successful configure or exported CUID
symbol alone does not establish compiled-in support.

* Confirm configure selected in-tree CUID or the intended installed package.
* Load the artifact's library, not a system copy, and check CUID entry points.
* For the in-tree build, confirm CUID objects are absorbed without installing a
  separate amdcuid header, archive or CMake package, and that
  `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/amdcuid.conf` is installed.
* Link a consumer of `amd_smi_static` through `find_package(amd_smi CONFIG)`.
  An installed-CUID build must resolve its exported amdcuid/Threads dependencies;
  an in-tree build must not require an external amdcuid package.
* Compare exported symbols with `BUILD_CUID=OFF` and keep the test-only sysfs
  override disabled in release artifacts.

Report actual pass/skip/fail counts, selected build paths and untested matrix
cells.
