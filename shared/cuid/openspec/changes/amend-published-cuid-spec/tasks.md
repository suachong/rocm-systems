No code. Every item is an edit to the published specification, and every one is already
implemented in both trees, which is what makes them safe. The exact replacement
text for each S1 item is in `specs/cuid/` beside this file.

## 1. S1: field tables

- [ ] 1.1 Primary table: narrow UnitID part 2 from `112:117` to `112:116`, and
      add a row naming bit 117 the Auxiliary Value Identifier. This is the edit
      that stops bit 117 having two owners.
- [ ] 1.2 Derived table: relabel the `72:116` slot from `hash[64:109]` to
      `hash[64:108]`, so the label matches the 45-bit width the table already
      gives it.
- [ ] 1.3 Derived prose: correct "110 bit LSB of the resulting hash" to 109, and
      "12 bits reserved" to 13.
- [ ] 1.4 State that UnitID is 13 bits total, split `64:71` / `112:116`.

## 2. S1: the fallback section

- [ ] 2.1 Correct the auxiliary input structure to Format `0:15` and Machine ID
      `16:143`, so both fields are whole octets.
- [ ] 2.2 Correct "32bit MachineID" to 128 bits, matching the `/etc/machine-id`
      the same row names.
- [ ] 2.3 Withdraw UUIDv5. Keep the UUIDv5 reference only as a note on the
      derivation *style*, stated explicitly not to describe the version nibble.
- [ ] 2.4 Delete the `amd.com` namespace string and the namespace form, which
      have no meaning once the auxiliary value is a normal UUIDv8.
- [ ] 2.5 State that a CPU's auxiliary Routing ID field is its physical package
      ID.
- [ ] 2.6 Widen the auxiliary Component Type row from `2/3/4` to the full
      on-wire numbering.

## 3. S1: values the specification leaves to the implementer

- [ ] 3.1 State the canonical fallback seed as the 24 ASCII octets
      `AMD-CUID-DEFAULT-SEED-v1`, unpadded and not NUL-terminated.
- [ ] 3.2 State the auxiliary fixed key as the 20 ASCII octets
      `AMD-CUID-TEMP-KEY-v1`, on the same terms, and pin the operand order.
- [ ] 3.3 State that a provisioned salt is exactly 32 octets and that any other
      length is refused rather than adopted.
- [ ] 3.4 State that the PCIe Device Serial Number is used in
      configuration-space order, little-endian and unswapped, read from
      `dsn_cap_offset + 4`.
- [ ] 3.5 State the NIC MAC fallback's orientation, and that a zero-valued
      source is absent rather than an identity.

## 4. S1: worked examples

- [ ] 4.1 Paste the conformance vectors from
      `pin-cuid-cross-layer-contract/specs/cuid/conformance-vectors/spec.md` in
      as normative text: the primary vectors, all six component types, the two
      derived vectors and the auxiliary pair.
- [ ] 4.2 State the obligation that every producer reproduces them, and that the
      artifact is shared rather than transcribed per producer.

## 5. S3 and S4

- [ ] 5.1 S3: renumber the device-type enumeration onto the on-wire values
      (`PLATFORM = 0x0` through `NPU = 0x4`) and note the sentinel move to
      `0xFF`.
- [ ] 5.2 S3: add NPU, which the page does not currently list.
- [ ] 5.3 S3: remove or correct the example call to a query that is not in the
      enumeration.
- [ ] 5.4 S3: repoint the fallback reference at S1.
- [ ] 5.5 Retire S4. It is empty, and it is the page S1's own reply cites as the
      authority for the bit tables. A duplicate is how the two got out of step.

## 6. Not edits to the page

- [ ] 6.1 Get an owner for the S3 enumeration change. It is a published API and
      the library change depends on it.
- [ ] 6.2 Decide whether the specification should say anything about the
      hypervisor opt-out. `amdgpu` implements one as a module parameter
      (`add-cuid-kernel-interface` D-8.1); the page currently describes no
      opt-out at any level.
