## Why

Writing the published specification down at version 84 made three things visible
that prose had been hiding:

- **Bit 117 has two owners.** The Primary table gives UnitID part 2 six bits,
  112:117. The Derived table gives bit 117 to the Auxiliary Value Identifier. No
  producer can satisfy both, and the two implementations that exist picked
  differently.
- **The derived hash slot is described three ways.** The slot is 45 bits wide
  (72:116), labelled `bits [64:109]` which is 46, inside prose that says 110.
- **The auxiliary input structure is off by one in two adjacent fields.** Format
  gets 17 bits and Machine ID gets 127, so the ranges total 256 while neither
  field is the size the row's own description requires.

Each produced a shipped defect. Alongside them the specification leaves values
unstated that every producer needs and therefore invents: the canonical fallback
seed, the auxiliary fixed key, the byte order of the PCIe Device Serial Number,
and what a CPU puts in a PCIe Routing ID field.

This change is the set of edits that would make the page say what the
implementations must do. It carries no code: the other three changes already
implement all of it. The kernel change's tasks 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4 are blocked on it.

## What Changes

- **Narrow UnitID part 2 to `112:116`**, five bits, and state that bit 117 is
  the Auxiliary Value Identifier in the Primary layout as well as the Derived
  one. **BREAKING** for any producer that packed a UnitID above 8191.
- **Fix the derived hash slot to `hash[64:108]`**, 45 bits, and correct the
  prose from 110 to 109. No conforming value changes; the table's own width was
  already right.
- **Repair the auxiliary input structure** to Format `0:15` and Machine ID
  `16:143`, so both fields are whole octets and the Machine ID can hold the
  128-bit `/etc/machine-id` the row names.
- **Correct "32bit MachineID" to 128 bits** in the fallback prose.
- **Withdraw UUIDv5 for auxiliary CUIDs.** An Auxiliary CUID becomes a normal
  UUIDv8 distinguished solely by bit 117, which the Derived table already
  defines for exactly that purpose. This voids the `amd.com` namespace string,
  the namespace form, and the question of HMAC operand order for the auxiliary
  path. **BREAKING** against the published text; not against either
  implementation, both of which already emit v8.
- **State the two key constants as literal octets**: `AMD-CUID-DEFAULT-SEED-v1`
  (24 octets) and `AMD-CUID-TEMP-KEY-v1` (20 octets), neither NUL-terminated nor
  padded.
- **State that the PCIe Device Serial Number is used in configuration-space
  order**, little-endian, unswapped, read from `dsn_cap_offset + 4`.
- **State that a CPU's auxiliary Routing ID field is its physical package ID**,
  since a CPU has no Bus/Device/Function of its own and its UnitID is zero on
  every socket.
- **Renumber the device-type enumeration in S3** onto the on-wire values, and
  add NPU, which S3 does not list.
- **Retire S4** and repoint S3's fallback reference at S1.
- **Publish the conformance vectors** from
  `pin-cuid-cross-layer-contract/specs/cuid/conformance-vectors` as normative
  text in S1.

## Capabilities

### Modified Capabilities

- `cuid/primary-identifier`: UnitID part 2 narrows to `112:116`; bit 117 named
  in the Primary layout.
- `cuid/derived-identifier`: the hash slot pinned at `hash[64:108]`; the key
  constants stated; the prose corrected.
- `cuid/auxiliary-fallback`: uniform UUIDv8 replaces UUIDv5; the input structure
  repaired; the CPU Routing ID and the fixed key stated.
- `cuid/component-discovery`: the Device Serial Number's byte order stated; the
  NIC MAC fallback's orientation stated.

### New Capabilities

_None. Everything here is a correction to, or a filling-in of, something the
published page already covers._

## Impact

- **Specification pages**: S1 takes the field-table and prose corrections and
  the worked examples. S3 takes the enumeration renumbering. S4 is retired.
- **Implementations**: none. The kernel driver and the userspace library already
  do all of this, which is what makes these edits safe.
- **Anything that recorded a library-emitted GPU CUID** before the enumeration
  renumbering holds a value that names a NIC. That is a consequence of the
  defect, not of this change, and is unavoidable either way.
