## Why

A derived CUID that is not temporary needs a node key that other local users
cannot read. The key lives in the UEFI variable `AmdCuidKey`, but efivarfs
creates every variable mode 0644, so the key is only private once efivarfs
creates secret variables 0600. That efivarfs change is outside amdgpu and has
its own review.

Primary CUIDs, UnitIDs, partition identities and temporary CUIDs need no key.
Holding them back until the key store is accepted delays everything that does
not depend on it.

## What Changes

The work lands as two series, the second on top of the first. This change
specifies the first and records the boundary; the second is
`adopt-uefi-key-store`.

**Identity (no key)**

- amdgpu publishes `cuid_primary` (0400) and `cuid_unit_id` (0444) for every
  whole GPU and every compute partition, and follows partition-mode switches.
  A partition's UnitID is its logical XCC range. No key, no HMAC, no EFI.
- The library takes a GPU or partition as driver-published when
  `cuid_unit_id` exists, and reads `cuid_primary` for root. Without a key there
  are no derived CUIDs that are not temporary: every caller gets a temporary
  CUID for CPUs, NICs, NPUs, the platform and whole GPUs, keyed by the machine
  ID. A partition has none.
- Only AMD GPUs are listed. A CPU's auxiliary Routing ID is its physical
  package ID.
- amd-smi reports primary and temporary CUIDs with their source, and
  `amd-smi node --cuid` lists every component. There is no key setter and no
  key state.
- **BREAKING** The daemon, key file, record store, `amdcuid_tool` and public
  default seed are removed, since nothing in this series uses a key.
  `amdcuid_set_hash_key()` and `amdcuid_get_key_info()` return
  `AMDCUID_STATUS_UNSUPPORTED`.

**Key store (on top, `adopt-uefi-key-store`)**

- efivarfs creates variables that hold secrets mode 0600, from a table of
  {GUID, name}. The first entry is systemd's `LoaderSystemToken`; the second is
  `AmdCuidKey`.
- amdgpu reads or creates `AmdCuidKey` and publishes `cuid_derived`,
  `cuid_seed` and `cuid_seed_state`.
- The library reads the key, `amdcuid_set_hash_key()` and
  `amd-smi set --cuid-seed` set it, and derived CUIDs replace temporary ones for
  root and, through `cuid_derived`, for everyone.

## Impact

- A library from either series works on a kernel from either series. With
  this series' library a key-store kernel's `cuid_derived` is not read.
- Until the key store lands no caller gets a partition CUID from the library:
  a partition has no temporary CUID because every partition of a GPU shares its
  parent's routing information. Root can read a partition's `cuid_primary` and
  `cuid_unit_id` from sysfs. An amd-smi handle for a GPU in SPX reports the
  whole GPU's CUID; one for a partition in DPX and above reports none.
- A NIC's UnitID is its PCI function number, so NIC functions that report one
  serial number have distinct CUIDs; amd-smi lists one component per PCI
  function.
- `amdsmi-seed-provisioning` and the `set --cuid-seed` requirement of
  `amdsmi-cli` in `integrate-cuid-into-amdsmi` wait for the key store.
- Supersedes, in other open changes: `key-constants` "Canonical fallback seed"
  and "Temporary and auxiliary fixed key"; `component-sources` "UnitID
  identifies a sub-unit" (index + 1); `library-consumer` staged lookup through
  `STORE` and key handling; the daemon, which no change specified.
- Code: kernel `amdgpu_cuid.{c,h}`, `amdgpu_xcp.c`, ABI document, KUnit;
  `shared/cuid/{lib,cli,daemon,scripts,tests}`; `projects/amdsmi`.
