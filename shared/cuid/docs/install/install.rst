Building and installing CUID
*****************************

This topic explains how to build and install the CUID library from source.

System requirements
====================

To build CUID from source, the following dependencies are required:

- CMake v3.21 or later
- G++ v7.0 or later (C++17)
- For Microsoft Windows: `Bcrypt <https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt?activeTab=code>`_ (Windows Native crypto library)

Building and installing CUID library
=====================================

To build and install the CUID library from source, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of CUID from the GitHub repository.

   .. code-block:: shell

    git clone --no-checkout --filter=blob:none https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems.git
    cd rocm-systems
    git sparse-checkout init --cone
    git sparse-checkout set shared/cuid
    git checkout develop
    cd rocm-systems/shared/cuid

2. Build and install the project using CMake. Run as root or use ``sudo``
   before running ``make install``.

   .. code-block:: shell

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j $(nproc)
    sudo make install

   .. note::

      The default install directory is ``/opt/rocm/core``. However, you can choose a different directory using the ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` option.

Installation ships the static library ``libamdcuid_static.a``, its header
``amd_cuid.h`` (under ``include/amdcuid``), a CMake package (``find_package(amdcuid)``, target
``amdcuid::amdcuid``) and ``/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/amdcuid.conf`` (``-DAMDCUID_TMPFILES_DIR`` to change
it), which makes the ``AmdCuidKey`` efivarfs variable mode 0600 at every boot
on a kernel whose efivarfs does not already create it 0600. Nothing else needs configuring: root
reads the node key from an amdgpu device's ``cuid_seed``, or the
``AmdCuidKey`` variable directly, once per enumeration or device lookup.

Provisioning the node key
==========================

A freshly installed node has no key of its own until either an amdgpu device
generates one on first module load, or an administrator sets one explicitly:

.. code-block:: shell

   head -c 32 /dev/urandom | sudo amd-smi set --cuid-seed -
   # or, to share one key across a fleet:
   sudo amd-smi set --cuid-seed /path/to/fleet-key.bin

Without a key, and for every non-root caller, CPU, NIC, NPU and platform CUIDs
are temporary. See :ref:`manage-node-key` for the full provisioning flow,
refusal rules and failure modes.
