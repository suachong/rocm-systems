//! `mirage_rocjitsu` — rocjitsu integration for the mirage binary.
//!
//! This crate exposes helpers the mirage binary needs at runtime:
//!
//! mirage does **not** build or embed the rocjitsu *library*
//! (`librocjitsu.so`); it is discovered at runtime from the installed
//! system (see [`kmd_preload`]).
//!
//! Runtime entry points:
//!
//! * [`kmd_config`] synthesises a runtime `SimulationConfig` JSON
//!   from an [`mirage_core::emulator::EmulatorDef`] by resolving its
//!   topology + agent references and wrapping them with rocjitsu's
//!   required runtime fields.
