//! `mirage run` and `mirage exec`: the two commands that start processes.
//!
//! They look symmetrical and are not, and the asymmetry is the whole
//! design:
//!
//! * `mirage run` **owns** a session. It brings one up in its own
//!   process, serves a socket so other terminals can find it, runs the
//!   command, and tears everything down on the way out. Nothing survives
//!   it.
//! * `mirage exec` **borrows** one. It asks a live run to describe its
//!   session, then starts the processes itself, in its own terminal, as
//!   its own children.
//!
//! The reason `exec` spawns locally rather than asking the run to do it
//! is terminals. A child inherits the standard streams of whoever forked
//! it, so a process started by the run process would talk to the run's
//! terminal — not to the terminal the user typed `mirage exec` into.
//! Having the client spawn is what makes `mirage exec -- bash` an
//! interactive shell in the window you ran it from, with no
//! pseudo-terminal, no output forwarding and no stdin relay.
//!
//! Both build their process grid with the same
//! [`mirage_supervisor::build_specs`], from the same description, so a
//! command behaves identically whichever way it was started.

///   handling it gives up: a core dump of mirage tells nobody anything,
///   and the exchange is a stranded session for a file that gets deleted.
/// * `SIGTERM` — `kill`, a CI runner cancelling a job, a service manager
///   stopping a unit.
/// * `SIGHUP` — the terminal window closed, which is the commonest way a
///   run is abandoned.
///
/// What is deliberately *not* here is as much of the rule as what is.

/// them to say "stop", they say whatever the workload decided they say.
/// They were in this list once, and being in it meant a scheduler's
/// checkpoint warning aborted the bring-up it was warning about and a
/// job checkpointing on a timer terminated itself on its second one. So
/// they are caught, forwarded, and counted for nothing; see
/// [`RELAY_SIGNALS`]. `SIGTSTP`, `SIGTTIN` and `SIGTTOU` are job control
/// rather than stopping — suspending a run must keep working, and
/// `SIGTTOU` in particular is blocked around the terminal handoff rather
/// than caught (see [`TerminalHandoff`]). `SIGPIPE` is already ignored

/// leaving the containers and the network it had already created behind.

/// Every workload process leads its own process group, so that mirage can
/// signal a forking workload's whole tree as a unit. The kernel's job
/// control rules then apply: a process in a *background* process group
/// that reads the controlling terminal is sent `SIGTTIN` and stopped. An
/// interactive `bash` started by `mirage run -- bash` would hang on the
/// first keystroke — not slowly, not intermittently, but every time.
///
/// The fix is the one a shell uses to put a job in the foreground:
/// `tcsetpgrp` the workload's process group onto the terminal, and take
/// it back when the workload is done. With the terminal theirs, reads
/// work, `Ctrl-C` and `Ctrl-Z` are delivered to the workload rather than
/// to mirage, and a shell's own job control works inside it.
///
/// # Why it is lent rather than given
///
/// "Delivered to the workload rather than to mirage" is the cost as well
/// as the point, so the handoff is made when the workload asks for the
/// terminal and not before — see [`lend_terminal`], which is the only
/// caller. A workload that never reads the terminal never takes it, and
/// mirage stays interruptible from the window it was started in.
///
/// # SIGTTOU
///
/// Giving the terminal *back* is itself a background write to it, which
/// earns `SIGTTOU` and would stop mirage exactly when it is trying to
/// clean up. `SIGTTOU` is therefore blocked around every `tcsetpgrp`.
/// Blocking — rather than installing a handler — is what makes
/// `tcsetpgrp` simply succeed, and it is available as a safe API.
///
/// The block is taken and released *around each call* rather than held
/// for the workload's lifetime, because `pthread_sigmask` is per-thread
/// and this value is dropped on whichever tokio worker the supervising
/// task happens to resume on. A mask blocked on the thread that called
/// [`TerminalHandoff::give_to`] says nothing about the thread that runs
