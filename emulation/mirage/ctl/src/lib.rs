//! `mirage_ctl`: the mirage command line.
//!
//! This crate is a **library**: it defines the top-level [`CtlCmd`]
//! subcommand enum and an async [`dispatch`] that runs each command. The
//! `mirage` binary is a thin wrapper around it.
//!
//! Commands fall into two groups, and the split is the whole shape of
//! mirage:
//!
//! * **Configuration** — `profile`, `topology`, `agent`, `state`,
//!   `paths`, `emulators`. Pure filesystem work against
//!   [`mirage_core::store`]. No session, no processes, nothing running.
//! * **Execution** — `run` and `exec`, in [`run`]. These own processes.
//!
//! There is no client/server split any more, and therefore no trait to
//! abstract one. `mirage run` *is* the runtime: it holds its session in
//! its own address space. `mirage exec` is the only command that talks
//! over a socket, and it asks exactly one question — see
//! [`mirage_core::proto`].
//!
//! All commands are documented in `docs/cli.md`.

/// Builtin profiles are not refreshed because they are not on disk:

/// exactly what this command must not do. It is named instead, because a
/// file under a builtin's name silently outranks the generated one
/// everywhere else.
///
/// Exit 0 when nothing failed, edited builtins included. `--help`
/// presents "a builtin you have edited is left alone and named" as the
/// ordinary outcome, and it is: every document that could be refreshed
/// was, nothing was lost, and there is nothing for the user to fix unless
/// they want the shipped version back. A non-zero exit would make an
/// upgrade script fail on a machine where the upgrade fully succeeded. A
