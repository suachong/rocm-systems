//! stops parsing fails the build instead of every run.
//!
//! The whole directory is read, rather than a list kept here by hand.
//! That list was three entries long while `rocjitsu/configs` held eleven
//! usable ones, so mirage could emulate an MI210 or a W7900 and had no
//! name for either. Adding a GPU to rocjitsu now adds it to mirage.

// A build script may panic: a config that is missing, unparseable or no
// longer an agent is not something the crate can be built without, and
// there is no caller to return an error to.
