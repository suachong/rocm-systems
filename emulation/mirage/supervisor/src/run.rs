//! [`Run`]: one session, owned by the process that started it.
//!
//! A `Run` is created by `mirage run` and lives exactly as long as that
//! process does. It brings a session up, hands out
//! [`SessionDescription`]s so other terminals can start processes in it,
//! and tears everything down on the way out.
//!
//! # Why there is no session manager
//!
//! There used to be one: a `SessionManager` holding a map of sessions
//! inside a long-lived daemon, because sessions outlived the commands
//! that created them and something had to own them in between. Every
//! awkward part of that design followed from the map — sessions had to be
//! looked up by id and could be missing; creation raced shutdown; a
//! shutdown flag had to be re-checked under a write lock; finished execs
//! had to be evicted because the daemon never exited and would otherwise
//! grow without bound.
//!
//! Making `mirage run` the owner removes the map, and with it every one
//! of those problems. There is one session, it is right here, and it
//! cannot outlive the process holding this value.
