//! Turning a session description plus a command into a process grid.
//!
//! This is the single place that decides what a workload process actually
//! is: which program, in which container, with which environment, on
//! which streams. Both callers go through it —
//!
//! * `mirage run`, which describes the session it just brought up, and
//! * `mirage exec`, which was handed the same description over the run's
//!   socket
//!
//! — and that is the point. The two live in different processes and
//! different terminals, and if they built specs separately they would
//! drift: an exec would end up with a slightly different `LD_PRELOAD`, or
//! a different rendezvous, or the wrong workdir inside a container, and
//! the symptom would be a workload that runs correctly under `run` and
//! mysteriously fails under `exec`. Sharing the builder makes that class
//! of bug unrepresentable.
//!
//! The mapping is very nearly a function of its inputs, and everything
//! it decides is testable without a container runtime or an emulator.
//! One thing it asks the world about is a containerised `--workdir`,
//! which is a question only the image can answer and is asked only when
//! the caller passed one. One more thing is read from the process rather
//! than passed in — which runtime directory this mirage resolved — and
//! both callers necessarily agree on it.
//!
//! Whether the caller's streams are a terminal used to be read here too,
//! and it was the one input that broke the promise above. A test runs
//! with its streams captured, so the probe answered `false` every time
//! and the interactive container path — the one that asks the provider
//! for `-t` — could not be reached from a test at all: the branch that
//! most needed pinning was the branch no test could enter. It is a
//! parameter now, [`CallerStreams`], which the caller probes once with
//! [`CallerStreams::probe`] and a test states outright.
//!
//! The ROCr preflight is the exception that stayed, and the promise
//! above is narrower for it. Once the concrete specs exist,
//! [`build_specs`] asks whether the ROCm runtime each host process will
//! load knows the ISA the session emulates — reading this process's
//! environment, the workload's executable and the runtime that
//! executable resolves — and prints a warning on stderr when it does
//! not. It is here because here is the only place both `mirage run` and
//! every `mirage exec` have a concrete command, workdir and environment
//! to ask about; an earlier version that lived in the run checked the
//! run and silently skipped every exec.
//!
//! What the `CallerStreams` lesson costs is paid rather than ignored.
//! The decision — which specs to ask about, which sessions to skip
//! without asking, how ranks that share loader inputs collapse to one
//! question, and what the notice says — is `unsupported_target_notices`,
//! a pure function of the description, the specs and a verdict its
//! caller supplies, which the tests drive with a stub. Ambient here is
//! the answer, never the policy.

/// of it. [`ExecDef::nproc_per_node`] is how many of a node's slots
/// *this* invocation fills, which is a question about how many processes
/// to start and about nothing else.
///
/// For `mirage run` the two are equal, which is why conflating them went
/// unnoticed: the run's own exec is the job. For `mirage exec` they are
/// not. Computing the world from the exec's count told a
/// `mirage exec` into a `--nproc-per-node 3` job that the world had two
/// processes in it rather than six, and numbered its ranks accordingly —
/// while still pointing them at the run's rendezvous port, so a
/// collective built on those numbers mis-forms instead of failing.
///
/// The rule that falls out, and the one the CLI documents:
///
/// * `mirage exec -- cmd` starts one process per node, each of them its
///   node's local rank 0 — ranks `0`, `P`, `2P`, … of a `WORLD_SIZE` of
///   `N * P`.
/// * `mirage exec --node n -- cmd` starts exactly that node's local rank
///   0, which leaves one process and therefore an interactive one.
/// * `--nproc-per-node k` fills the first `k` slots of each node it runs
///   on, and `k` may not exceed the job's own `P`: rank `node * P + P` is
///   the next node's rank 0, and two live processes claiming one rank in
///   one rendezvous is the failure this whole section exists to prevent.
/// * The two compose. `--node n --nproc-per-node k` is `k` processes on
///   node `n`, ranks `n*P` through `n*P + k - 1`. `--node` chooses
///   *where*; the process count chooses the streams, and the count is
///   what decides — so this shape is captured and labelled, exactly as a
///   `k`-process exec across every node would be. `--node` alone is
///   interactive because it leaves one process, not because it named a
///   node, and stating it the other way round is what made the CLI
///   documentation contradict this module.
///
/// # Where a containerised workload starts
///
/// The two paths do not share a default working directory, and cannot.
///
/// On the host, a workload with no `--workdir` starts in
/// [`SessionDescription::workdir`] — the directory `mirage run` was
/// typed in — which is what makes `mirage run -- ./my-app` behave like
/// running `./my-app`.
///
/// In a container there is no equivalent, because the host's directory
/// is a host path and the container has its own filesystem. Carrying it
/// across would fail every run started anywhere but a bind-mounted
/// directory, and fail it in the most confusing possible way: with a
/// `chdir` error about a path the user never asked for. So mirage passes
/// no `-w` at all and the workload starts wherever the image says it
/// does — its `WORKDIR`, which is `/` for an image that declares none.
/// That is the image's answer to the same question rather than a guess
/// of mirage's, and `--workdir` overrides it; a path there is checked
/// against the container before anything runs, so getting it wrong costs
/// an error and not a failed workload.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns an error if the world size exceeds [`MAX_WORLD_SIZE`], if the
/// exec asks for more processes per node than the job has slots for, if
/// a containerised `--workdir` names a directory the image does not
