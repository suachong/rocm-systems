//! Spawning, supervising and reliably killing workload processes.
//!
//! This module is where mirage's zombie problem was, and where it is
//! fixed. Three properties are maintained, and every one of them is a
//! response to a way the previous design leaked:
//!
//! 1. **Every child is waited on.** A spawned child is owned by exactly
//!    one task, and that task's only exit path runs through
//!    [`Child::wait`]. A child that is never waited on stays in the
//!    process table as a zombie until its parent dies, and the previous
//!    design's detached per-session host frequently exited without
//!    reaping — leaving zombies parented to a process that was itself
//!    gone.
//!
//! 2. **Every child leads its own process group.** Children are spawned
//!    with `process_group(0)`, so a workload that forks (a shell script,
//!    `torchrun`, an MPI launcher) puts its whole tree in one group that
//!    can be signalled as a unit. Signalling only the direct child would
//!    leave the grandchildren running — invisible, still holding the GPU
//!    socket, still holding ports.
//!
//!    That group is swept — `SIGKILL` to the group — as part of *reaping*
//!    the child rather than as part of teardown, so it happens however
//!    the workload finished. The sweep used to live at the end of
//!    [`Spawned::terminate`] alone, and the supervisor only reaches
//!    `terminate` when a run is cancelled: a workload that exited on its
//!    own — the ordinary case — left everything it had forked running,
//!    reparented to init, while mirage reported the exec finished and
//!    deleted the session out from under it.
//!
//!    Note this is a *safe* API. The equivalent in the old design was a
//!    `pre_exec` closure calling `setsid()`, which required `unsafe` and
//!    ran arbitrary code between fork and exec in a process where almost
//!    nothing is legal to call.
//!
//! 3. **Termination escalates and then confirms.** [`Spawned::terminate`] sends
//!    `SIGTERM` to the group, waits a bounded grace period, sends
//!    `SIGKILL`, and only returns once the child has actually been
//!    reaped. `SIGKILL` cannot be caught, so the second stage always
//!    ends; the confirmation is what makes "the session is destroyed" a
//!    statement about the process table rather than about intent.
//!
//! One backstop sits under that, for the case where the escalation above
//! never gets to run: `kill_on_drop(true)`, so a supervising task that is
//! cancelled abruptly kills its child rather than orphaning it.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not covered: `SIGKILL` of mirage itself
//!
//! Every property above needs mirage to still be running — a signal it
//! sends, a `Drop` it runs, a task tokio cancels. `kill -9`, and the OOM
//! killer picking mirage during a large emulated job, leave no code of
//! ours to run at all, and the workload is reparented to init still
//! holding the emulated device.
//!
//! This module used to close that with `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`, set in a
//! `pre_exec` closure so the kernel would kill each child when its parent
//! went away. That was the workspace's only `unsafe`, and it never
//! covered the case that mattered most: node containers are launched from
//! a `spawn_blocking` thread, and pdeathsig tracks the parent *thread*,
//! so a retired pool thread would have killed a healthy run's containers.
//! Covering both would have meant two mechanisms rather than one.
//!
//! The trade is taken the other way instead. A `SIGKILL`ed run is allowed
//! to strand its workloads, and `mirage cleanup` reclaims them: every
//! workload carries [`MIRAGE_SESSION`](mirage_core::container::ENV_SESSION)
//! in its environment, the same way every container carries a
//! `mirage.owner` label, so the recovery path can find what is stranded
//! without any bookkeeping that a `SIGKILL` could interrupt.
//!
//! # Standard streams
//!
//! A workload gets the *caller's* streams, not ones mirage manufactured.
//! Whoever spawns a process here — `mirage run`, or a `mirage exec` in
//! another terminal — is the process the user is sitting in front of, so
//! inheriting its file descriptors puts the workload on the user's real
//! terminal.
//!
//! That is worth stating because the obvious alternative is what mirage
//! used to do, and it was worse in every direction. A long-lived daemon
//! owned every workload, so the workload's terminal could not be the
//! user's; it had to be a pseudo-terminal the daemon allocated, with
//! output shipped back over a socket and keystrokes shipped forward. The
//! costs were real: a PTY has one stream, so stdout and stderr were
//! merged and redirecting one of them stopped working; the client had to
//! put the user's terminal in raw mode and forward `SIGWINCH` by hand;
//! and `pre_exec`-based session-leader setup was the only `unsafe` in
//! the workspace.
//!
//! Inheriting deletes all of it. An interactive `bash` works because its
//! stdin *is* the terminal, not because mirage emulated one.
//!
//! [`StdioMode::Capture`] is the exception, and exists for one reason:
//! several ranks writing to one terminal are unreadable without labels.
//! Capturing puts mirage back in the middle so it can prefix each chunk
//! with the rank that produced it, at the price of stdin.

/// of two states, and they call for opposite responses:
///
/// * **Blocked reading.** A descendant that outlived the workload still
///   holds the write end of the pipe, so the read will never return and
///   no amount of waiting produces another byte. The pump has to be
///   aborted or teardown never finishes.
/// * **Blocked delivering.** The pump has read output the workload really
///   produced and the consumer — a terminal, a client reading the exec's
///   stream — has not taken the previous chunk yet. Aborting here throws
///   away bytes the workload wrote, silently.
///
/// A grace period on its own cannot tell them apart at any threshold: a
/// multi-rank job printing faster than the terminal drains looks exactly
/// like a wedged pipe, and lengthening the timeout only moves the point
/// at which output starts disappearing. Naming the state instead makes
/// the distinction exact and costs one atomic per stream.
///
/// # Why one atomic and not two
///
/// The count and the flag were separate atomics, and the drain's
/// correctness rests on their *order*: the count must appear to advance
/// before the flag clears, so that a sample taken in between reads a
/// pump that has just delivered as one that is still delivering rather
/// than as one wedged on a pipe. Two `Relaxed` stores to two locations
/// give no such guarantee — relaxed operations are ordered per location
/// and not against each other, so a reader is entitled to observe the
/// cleared flag and the stale count, which is exactly the sample that
/// aborts a healthy pump and truncates the workload's output.
///
/// Release/acquire pairs would have restored the ordering. Packing both
/// into one `u64` removes the question instead: there is one location,
/// one store per transition, and a coherence order every observer agrees
/// on — so "these two values are consistent with each other" stops being
/// something the code has to arrange and becomes something it cannot

    /// That is not always the child: a forked grandchild inherits the
    /// write end, so if one outlives its parent the pipe stays open and

    /// grandchild is already dead by the time this runs — but one that
    /// left the group is not, and it is that pump the bounded wait and
    /// the abort exist for.
    ///
    /// The bound applies to that state and no other. A pump can equally
    /// still be alive because it is holding output the workload really
    /// produced and the consumer has not taken the previous chunk yet —
    /// a multi-rank job printing faster than the terminal drains — and
    /// aborting there silently truncates the workload's own output. The
    /// two are told apart by [`PumpProgress`] rather than by the clock: a
    /// pump that is holding a chunk, or that delivered one during the
    /// last grace period, is making progress and is waited on for as long
    /// as it keeps doing so, while one that has done neither is blocked
    /// on a pipe nobody will ever close and is aborted. Lengthening
    /// [`DRAIN_GRACE`] instead would only have moved the threshold: no
    /// fixed grace period separates a slow consumer from a wedged pipe.
    ///
    /// Waiting on a pump that is delivering cannot hang teardown. A send
    /// blocks only while a receiver is alive, and when the last one goes
    /// away the send fails and the pump returns — so the wait ends either
    /// with the output delivered or with nobody left to deliver it to.
    ///
    /// The abort is load-bearing and must be explicit. *Dropping* a tokio
    /// `JoinHandle` detaches its task rather than cancelling it, so a
    /// pump left behind that way would run for the lifetime of the daemon
    /// holding a pipe fd and a clone of the exec's `OutputChunk` sender —
    /// and because that sender never drops, the channel never closes and
    /// `forward_output` never ends either.
    ///
    /// Which is also why each handle stays in `self.pumps` until it has
    /// been joined or aborted. `Vec::drain` hands ownership to the
    /// iterator, so this whole function being cancelled — the supervisor
    /// races `wait` against a cancellation token, and the drain is inside
