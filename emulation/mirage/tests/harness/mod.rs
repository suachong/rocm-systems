//! Shared harness for the end-to-end CLI tests.
//!
//! Every test gets a private XDG root and therefore its own config store
//! and run directory. That isolation is what lets the suite run in
//! parallel and lets a test make absolute claims — "no run is live", "no
//! process is left running" — without another test's state making the
//! claim false.
//!
//! # There is nothing to tear down
//!
//! A `mirage run` is a foreground process, so a test owns its lifetime
//! directly: it spawns one and kills it, or waits for it to exit. There
//! is no daemon to stop on drop, no socket to unlink, and no way for a
//! test that panics mid-assertion to strand a background process — the
//! run is a child of the test binary, and [`Run`] kills it in its own
//! `Drop`.

// `dead_code` is the one that cannot be narrowed. This module is compiled
// separately into each of the five integration-test binaries, and none of
// them uses all of it — so every helper is dead code from the point of
// view of at least one binary, and the lint has no way to see the others.
// Everything else here is ordinary test-code opt-out: a panic in a test
// *is* the failure mechanism.
