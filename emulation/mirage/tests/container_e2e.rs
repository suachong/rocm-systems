//! End-to-end tests for the containerised workflow, using a mock
//! container provider (a small shell script standing in for
//! `docker`/`podman`). No real container runtime is required.
//!
//! These assert the full containerised lifecycle:
//!
//! * `mirage profile create --image … --container-provider <mock>`
//!   records the containerisation on the profile;
//! * a `mirage run` on that profile pulls the image, creates the
//!   per-session network and launches one container per node;
//! * the workload runs *inside* the node container, via the provider's
//!   `exec`, and so does a `mirage exec` from another terminal;
//! * when the run ends — cleanly or not — every container and the
//!   network go with it;
//! * and the configurations that could never work — a mount laid over
//!   mirage's own directory in the container, a published port on a
//!   multi-node session, an empty image, a provider that is not an
//!   engine — are refused before anything is created, in mirage's words
//!   rather than the engine's.
//!
//! # Why the mock stays in the foreground
//!
//! A node container used to be launched with `run -d`: the provider
//! client exited immediately, the container was detached, and its
//! lifetime was whatever remembered to remove it later. A session
//! outlived the command that created it, so that was the only option.
//!
//! It is not any more. `mirage run` owns its session, so a container is
//! launched with `run --rm` and *no* `-d`: the provider client is a child
//! process mirage holds for as long as the container should live, and
//! `--rm` deletes the container the moment that client goes away —
//! however it went away. The mock reproduces exactly that shape (it
//! blocks until its parent dies, then removes its own record), because a
//! mock that returned immediately would let a regression back to `-d`
//! pass every test in this file.
//!
//! The mock enforces `--rm` on itself, though, which is the one thing it
//! cannot be trusted about: it is playing both sides of the contract. So
//! one test here drives the machine's real podman or docker end to end —
//! `a_real_engine_creates_and_removes_the_container_with_the_run` — and
//! skips when neither is installed with the image it needs.
