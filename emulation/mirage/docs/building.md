# Building mirage

This guide covers building the `mirage` CLI and (optionally) the
`rocjitsu` GPU emulator that mirage drives.

mirage is a single Cargo workspace ([`emulation/mirage/`](../)). One
`cargo build` produces the unified `mirage` binary from a set of crates —
`core`, `ctl`, `supervisor`, `container`, `builtin`, `rocjitsu_sys`, and
the emulator backends (`rocjitsu`, `hotswap`). See
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md) for the full crate map.

## TL;DR

```sh
cd emulation/mirage
cargo build            # builds everything
cargo test --workspace # run the test suite
./target/debug/mirage --help
```

Rust is the only toolchain the mirage build itself needs. Everything
below that is about rocjitsu, which is a separate C++ project mirage
merely loads at runtime.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Needed for | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| Rust + Cargo | 1.88+ (edition 2024) | everything | Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs). 1.88 is the floor for let-chains, which the workspace uses. |
| CMake | 3.22+ | building rocjitsu from source | Only if you want live GPU emulation. mirage's own wrapper needs 3.20. |
| Ninja | any recent | building rocjitsu from source | `-G Ninja`. |
| C++20 compiler | GCC 12+ / Clang 16+ | building rocjitsu from source | |
| Python | 3.10+ | regenerating rocjitsu's ISA sources | Not a build prerequisite: the generated sources are checked in, and nothing in either CMake build invokes Python. Only needed to re-run the `amdisa` generator. |

mirage runs on Linux. It leans on POSIX process groups and Unix domain
sockets: each workload process leads its own group so it can be
signalled as a unit, and each `mirage run` serves one socket under
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/mirage/run/` so `mirage exec` in another terminal can
find it.

## Building the workspace

```sh
cd emulation/mirage
cargo build              # debug
cargo build --release    # optimized
```

This builds the `mirage` binary at `target/debug/mirage` (or
`target/release/mirage`). The build embeds:

- the **builtin agents, topologies and profiles** — Rust constructors in
  the `builtin` crate, so the data is validated by the compiler rather
  than by a runtime parse, and
- the **third-party dependency manifest** that `mirage about` prints,
  distilled from `cargo metadata` by the root `build.rs`.

### Cargo features

The only optional things in the workspace are the emulator backends.
Each is a link-only dependency that registers itself into the emulator
registry via `inventory`; nothing in the binary names a backend, so a
feature flag literally adds or removes an entry from
`mirage emulators`.

| Feature | Default | Backend |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `rocjitsu` | on | two entries: `rocjitsu`, the GPU emulator, and `rocjitsu-dbt`, which translates a GPU's code objects to run on a different physical GPU |
| `hotswap` | off | the HotSwap intercept backend |

```sh
cargo build                                              # rocjitsu only
cargo build --features hotswap                           # both
cargo build --no-default-features --features hotswap     # hotswap only
```

A build with no backend at all compiles, but `profile create` then fails
with a message telling you to rebuild with one — a profile has to name
an emulator, and there is none to name.

### Building through CMake

There is a thin CMake wrapper ([`CMakeLists.txt`](../CMakeLists.txt)) so
mirage configures, installs and tests with the same recipe as the rest
of the monorepo. It shells out to cargo:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build      # cargo build --release
ctest --test-dir build   # the test suite, plus clippy and rustfmt
```

`ctest` runs three cases, not one: `cargo_test`, and the two lint gates
described under [Linting](#linting).

Options worth knowing: `MIRAGE_CARGO_FEATURES` (comma-separated extra
cargo features), `MIRAGE_CARGO_PROFILE` (default `release`),
`MIRAGE_BUILD_HOTSWAP` (build HotSwap's LLVM + COMGR + ROCR stack from
source — a long build, hence opt-in), `MIRAGE_LINT_TESTS` (on; turn it
off to register only `cargo_test`), and `MIRAGE_ALLOW_TEST_SKIP`, which
is the `ctest` spelling of `MIRAGE_E2E_ALLOW_SKIP=1` described below.

## Building rocjitsu

rocjitsu is the emulator mirage drives, so mirage needs its libraries to
bring a session up. Without them:

* `mirage emulators` reports the backend as not installed;
* `mirage run` fails at bring-up, naming the missing library;
* the end-to-end test suites cannot bring a session up, so every test in
  them skips.

Because a skipped Rust test still reports `ok`, each of those suites
carries one guard test that **fails** in that situation rather than
letting the suite go green while proving nothing. So a `cargo test` in a
checkout without rocjitsu built reports a handful of deliberate failures
whose message says exactly what is missing:

```console
the `rocjitsu` runtime was not found, so every session test in this suite
skipped and the suite proves nothing.

Build the sibling `emulation/rocjitsu` project, or set ROCM_HOME to an
install that provides librocjitsu.so.

If this build deliberately excludes rocjitsu, set MIRAGE_E2E_ALLOW_SKIP=1
to accept the skips.
```

Set `MIRAGE_E2E_ALLOW_SKIP=1` for a build that intentionally excludes
rocjitsu — a docs-only CI job, say. Prefer building rocjitsu where you
can: those suites are where mirage's session and process lifecycle is
actually covered.

### Option A — let mirage find them

Every backend resolves its runtime library through one shared search
policy, so what works for one works for the others. For rocjitsu
(`librocjitsu.so`) the order is:

1. `$ROCJITSU_LIB`, which names the `.so` **file** itself rather than a
   directory;
2. every directory on `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`;
3. an install layout — `<prefix>/lib` next to a `<prefix>/bin/mirage`.
   This outranks everything below it on purpose: a prefix that ships its
   own library must use it, even when the prefix happens to sit inside a
   checkout whose `emulation/rocjitsu/build` also has one;
4. a sibling monorepo build, found by walking up from the `mirage`
   binary and looking for a rocjitsu build under each ancestor — so an
   integration-test binary in `target/<profile>/deps/` finds it just as
   the CLI does, without anybody counting `..`s;
5. `$ROCM_HOME/lib`, then `$ROCM_PATH/lib`;
6. `$(rocm-sdk path --root)/lib` (present when a ROCm Python wheel venv
   is active);
7. the standard system directories: `/opt/rocm/lib`, `/usr/local/lib`,
   `/usr/lib`, `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`;
8. the in-container mount directory, for a containerised session where
   the host libraries are bind-mounted in.

The first path that is actually a file wins. `$ROCJITSU_LIB` naming
something that is not there is skipped rather than fatal, so an
environment left over from another checkout degrades to the search rather
than breaking the build.

The DBT backend follows the same policy for `librocjitsu_hooks.so`, with
`ROCJITSU_HOOKS_LIB` in place of `ROCJITSU_LIB`. HotSwap is the one that
opts out: it takes `HOTSWAP_HOME` (an install root, with
`lib/libhotswap_intercept.so` under it) and does not consult
`$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or the ROCm variables at all.

Reach for the file overrides — `ROCJITSU_LIB`, `ROCJITSU_HOOKS_LIB` — when
you have a library in a place no search would guess, or when you want to
pin one build while another sits in the way. They are also what you need
when the prefix itself is the problem: step 3 outranks
`ROCM_HOME`/`ROCM_PATH`, so those two select an ordinary install root but
cannot override a `<prefix>/lib` beside the `mirage` you are running —
only `ROCJITSU_LIB` or `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` can.

You do not have to reason about any of this in the dark. `mirage
emulators -l` prints, per backend, the library it resolved — or, when it
found none, every path it tried and the variables that would fix it:

```sh
$ mirage emulators -l
hotswap
  ...
  installed: no
  runtime:   not found (libhotswap_intercept.so)
  searched:  /path/that/was/tried/libhotswap_intercept.so
  set:       HOTSWAP_HOME=<install root, with lib/libhotswap_intercept.so under it>
```

If nothing is found mirage still builds and runs; the backend is simply
reported as not installed.

### Option B — build rocjitsu yourself

From the rocjitsu source tree
([`emulation/rocjitsu/`](../../rocjitsu)):

```sh
cd emulation/rocjitsu
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

### Verifying rocjitsu is wired up

```sh
./target/debug/mirage state builtins        # extract agents/topologies
./target/debug/mirage profile create gpu --emulator rocjitsu --no-input
./target/debug/mirage run --profile gpu -- \
  sh -c 'echo LD=$LD_PRELOAD ROCJITSU_RUNTIME_DIR=$ROCJITSU_RUNTIME_DIR'
```

If the profile is created successfully and `LD_PRELOAD` /
`ROCJITSU_RUNTIME_DIR` are populated in the run, rocjitsu is integrated.
Profile creation
validates against the emulator, so an unusable rocjitsu setup is
reported at `profile create` time with the reason.

## Testing

```sh
cargo test --workspace   # unit tests + the integration suites
```

The integration suites under `tests/` drive the real binary as a
subprocess against a private XDG root, so what they exercise is the
whole stack: CLI → session bring-up → supervisor → real processes.
`tests/e2e.rs` covers a run's streams, its exit code, the socket it
serves while it lives, and `mirage exec` borrowing that session from
another terminal; `tests/container_e2e.rs` does the same for a
containerised profile; `tests/matrix_e2e.rs` walks the backend ×
topology × plugin cross product from [`tests/matrix.md`](../tests/matrix.md);
`tests/strain.rs` hammers the lifecycle for leaks. `supervisor/tests/`
covers the run and process layer directly.

Because a session only exists while the `mirage run` that owns it is
alive, every one of those tests is bounded by a process it started: a
suite that crashes cannot leave a session behind for the next one to
trip over.

## Linting

The workspace lint policy lives in [`Cargo.toml`](../Cargo.toml) under
`[workspace.lints]`: `unsafe_code` is forbidden everywhere except the
`rocjitsu_sys` FFI crate, `clippy::all` is denied, and `unwrap_used`,
`expect_used`, `panic`, `exit`, `todo`, `unimplemented`, `dbg_macro` and a
few concurrency hazards (`await_holding_lock`, `mem_forget`) are denied
outside test modules.

The table has two halves and only one of them is free. The `rust` half —
`unsafe_code`, `unused_must_use`, `rust_2018_idioms` — is applied by
rustc, so `cargo build` already enforces it. The clippy half is applied
only when clippy is what you ran, and `cargo test` never runs clippy. So
run it:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

Every flag is load-bearing. `--all-targets` reaches the integration test
targets under `tests/`, which are where most of the `unwrap` temptation
lives; `--all-features` reaches the `hotswap` backend that the default
feature set leaves uncompiled; and `-D warnings` is what turns the
warn-level entries in the policy (`unreachable_pub`,
`unused_qualifications`, `missing_debug_implementations`) into failures
rather than output you scroll past.

Both checks are also registered as `ctest` cases (`cargo_clippy` and
`cargo_fmt`) unless `MIRAGE_LINT_TESTS` is turned off, so a CMake-driven
build catches a lint regression the same way it catches a failing test.
`cmake --build build --target mirage_lint` runs just those two without the
test suite.

## Troubleshooting

- **`command not found: <cmd>` from `mirage run`** — the program you asked
  mirage to run doesn't exist on `PATH` inside the session. The rank that
  couldn't start reports `mirage: node <n>: <reason>` on mirage's own
  stderr and records exit code 127, rather than the exec quietly running
  the ranks that did start.
- **`no mirage run is serving session <id>`** — the run that owned the
  session has exited. A session exists exactly as long as its `mirage
  run` does; start one in another terminal and `mirage exec` into that.
- **The workload sees no GPU, and exits 0 anyway** — `rocminfo` reports
  only the CPU agent, the session came up normally and nothing failed.
  Almost always this is a ROCm that predates the GPU the session
  emulates: `libhsa-runtime64.so` enumerates agents by looking their ISA
  up in the table it was compiled with, and one it does not recognise is
  skipped without a word. Before each host workload starts, mirage
  statically checks the command's unambiguous direct `DT_RUNPATH`
  resolution and warns —

  > `mirage: the ROCm runtime this workload will load does not support
  > gfx1250, which is the GPU this session emulates. …`

  — naming the resolved runtime and the ROCm version beside it. Run the
  workload under a newer ROCm (`mirage run --image <a newer ROCm image>`
  is the usual way), or emulate a GPU this ROCm supports: a session's
  target comes from its profile, or from the device a drop-in `--config`
  describes. A `--config` with a DBT guest enabled names no target, because
  the session presents the host's devices and the guest together. The
  check is deliberately conservative — it warns only for a
  trusted system executable that links ROCr directly through a modern
  absolute or `$ORIGIN`-based `RUNPATH`, with no loader override or
  hardware-capability alternative in the way. Everything else stays
  silent: user-built executables, anything that loads ROCr later with
  `dlopen` (Python included), transitive dependencies, legacy `RPATH`,
  cache-only resolution, preloads including a system-wide
  `/etc/ld.so.preload`, HSA overrides, and set-ID or file-capability
  executables. Its silence therefore does not rule this cause out.
- **A backend reported as not installed** — run `mirage emulators -l`
  first. It prints every path that was searched for that backend's
  library and the environment variables that would resolve it, which is
  faster than guessing. Then either build rocjitsu (Option B), or point
  `ROCJITSU_LIB` (or `ROCJITSU_HOOKS_LIB`, or `HOTSWAP_HOME`) at a
  library you already have.
