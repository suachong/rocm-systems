//! The ROCm runtime a workload will load, and the GPU targets it knows
//! how to enumerate.
//!
//! An emulated device is only half of a working session. mirage (through
//! rocjitsu) synthesises a KFD node for the GPU a session emulates, and
//! then something has to *recognise* it: `libhsa-runtime64.so`, the ROCm
//! runtime the workload itself loads, reads that node's
//! `gfx_target_version`, looks the ISA up in the table it was compiled
//! with, and — when the ISA is not in that table — skips the agent
//! entirely.
//!
//! Skips it silently. The emulated device is presented correctly, the
//! emulator daemon logs the same lines it logs for a target that works,
//! the workload runs, sees a CPU agent and no GPU, and exits 0. Nothing
//! anywhere says the target was the problem, and the obvious reading of
//! that evidence — that the emulator is broken for this GPU — is wrong
//! and expensive: it cost about a day of investigation, and was very
//! nearly filed as an emulator bug (issue #11361).
//!
//! So mirage asks the question before each workload starts. Which ROCm
//! runtime does this command's dynamic loader resolve, and can its image
//! rule out the ISA the session emulates?
//!
//! "The session", throughout, and never "the profile". The two usually
//! name the same GPU and a profile is the usual way to choose it, but a
//! drop-in `--config` describes a device of its own, and what a session
//! emulates is read from the configuration it was brought up on. The
//! terminology matters at the one point it is visible: the warning below
//! tells a user what to change, and naming the profile would send
//! somebody to edit an input that is not deciding it.
//!
//! # Why the answer is read out of the library's own image
//!
//! There is no side-effect-free API for it. `hsa_isa_from_name` would
//! answer exactly this question but needs `hsa_init()` first, which would
//! initialise ROCr in mirage's own process rather than inspect the
//! library and environment selected for the workload. What the binary
//! does guarantee is one-way: every ISA in the registry leaves its
//! target name in the image, and other ROCr subsystems — legacy
//! code-object conversion among them — leave target names there too. So
//! presence proves nothing, and only absence from a recognisably
//! complete ROCr image is a verdict.
//!
//! That is evidence rather than an interface, so this module fails
//! towards silence: a missing loader answer, an unreadable runtime, a
//! target mention, or too few target references all yield no verdict,
//! and even a verdict warns rather than refuses, because this diagnostic
//! must never block a run that would have worked.
