//! Profile: a reusable bundle of emulator configuration.
//!
//! # Why every document type here rejects unknown fields
//!
//! These are files people write and edit by hand, and mirage acts on
//! them: a profile decides how many GPUs the emulated machine has, which
//! image its nodes run in, and what is mounted into them. A key serde
//! does not recognise is, overwhelmingly, a key that was *meant* to do
//! something — `"descriptoin"`, `"read-only"`, a field from a newer
//! mirage — and dropping it silently means the machine that comes up is
//! quietly not the one the file describes. `deny_unknown_fields` turns
//! that into a parse error naming the key, at the moment the document is
//! read, which is the only moment the user is still looking at it.
//!
//! The cost is forward compatibility in one direction: a document written
//! by a newer mirage that added a field is rejected by an older one
//! rather than degraded. That is the trade we want. An older mirage
//! cannot honour a field it has never heard of, so its choice is between
//! saying so and running something else instead; and adding an *optional*
//! field is still fully backward compatible, because older documents that
//! omit it keep parsing. Only removals and renames need care, and those
//! need care anyway.
