//! The on-disk configuration store: profiles, topologies and agents.
//!
//! These are user-authored documents, not session state. They live in the
//! config directory, they outlive every process, and reading one involves
//! nothing but the filesystem.
//!
//! That last point is why this module exists separately from the
//! supervisor. Every command answers configuration queries from here
//! directly, so `mirage profile list` is a directory read and nothing
//! else — there is nothing to start first. There is no cache to keep
//! coherent either: a `mirage run` reads a profile off disk when it
//! creates its session, so a profile written a moment earlier in another
//! terminal is already visible to it.
//!
//! A *write* asks two more questions, below.
//!
//! # Not every document is a file
//!
//! Mirage's builtin profiles are generated rather than stored: each is
//! derived from a rocjitsu config the binary carries, on demand, and
//! nothing is written to `<config>/profile/` ([`BuiltinProfiles`]). So a
//! profile that resolves is not necessarily a profile with a file, and
//! every profile file that *does* exist is the user's own. Builtin
//! agents and topologies are still seeded onto disk, because those are
//! documents a user edits and refers to by name.
//!
//! # Writes never destroy the user's work
//!
//! These files are the user's, and this module is the one door every
//! writer goes through, so the rule lives here rather than in each
//! command. Three things follow from it, and [`shipped`] — the set of
//! documents mirage itself seeds into a fresh config directory — is what
//! tells them apart:
//!
//! * A write that would replace a document mirage did not write is
//!   refused ([`profile_put`], [`topology_put`], [`agent_put`] alike —
//!   the three resource verbs are parallel, and a user has no way to
//!   infer that one of them destroys their work where the others refuse).
//!   Replacing a *pristine* builtin is fine: it is mirage's own seed and
//!   identical to the copy still compiled into the binary — but the
//!   caller is told it happened ([`Stored`]), because a builtin
//!   disappearing without a word is the same defect one level down.
//!   The name is claimed from the filesystem rather than from a stat, so
//!   two `create`s racing for it produce one winner and one refusal
//!   instead of two successes (see `write_new`).
//! * A delete of a pristine builtin is refused, because mirage rewrites
//!   every missing builtin on the next command — the file would come
//!   straight back and the "deleted" would have been a lie. Deleting one
//!   the user *has* changed is allowed, and is how a customised builtin
//!   is reset to the shipped version. A *generated* builtin is refused
//!   for the neighbouring reason: there is no file to remove, and the
//!   name would still resolve afterwards.
//! * A profile is checked before it lands, not when a session later tries
//!   to use it: its name, the topology and agent references inside it,
//!   and whether its emulator backend will accept it at all. A topology
//!   is checked the same way, for the same reason — see [`topology_put`].
//!
//! # A delete says what it broke
//!
//! Nothing here refuses a delete because another document refers to the
//! victim: the files are the user's. But a reference that stops resolving
//! is a failure they will meet later, in a command that has no visible
//! connection to the delete, so [`referrers_to`] names the documents that
//! just lost their target and the delete says so on the way out.
