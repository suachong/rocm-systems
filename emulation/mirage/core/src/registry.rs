//! Emulator registry primitives.
//!
//! Every emulator backend lives in its own crate and registers itself
//! into a global registry via [`inventory`] (see
//! [`crate::emulator::EmulatorBackendDef`]). This module assembles that
//! registry into a list of [`EmulatorInfo`] — each backend's static
//! [`crate::emulator::EmulatorDescription`] plus its live runtime status (installed,
//! where its runtime library is or was looked for, and whether this host
//! supports it) — and provides the generic [`find`] /
//! [`default_emulator`] / [`make_def`] helpers that operate over a
//! supplied slice of them.
//!
//! No backend is named here: the list is whatever set of backend
//! crates was compiled into the binary, so disabling a backend's
//! feature simply drops it from the registry.
//!
//! Named hardware agents ([`crate::agent::AgentDef`]) and system
//! topologies ([`crate::topology::TopologyDef`]) live in the
//! `mirage_builtin` crate; the on-disk store policy for them lives in
//! [`crate::agent::store`] / [`crate::topology::store`].
