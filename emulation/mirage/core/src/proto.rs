//! The wire protocol between `mirage exec` and the `mirage run` that owns
//! a session.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! A `mirage run` owns exactly one session, for exactly as long as that
//! process lives. While it is up it serves a Unix socket in the runtime
//! directory, named after the session. The socket answers one question:
//! *how do I start a process in this session?*
//!
//! A client connects, sends one [`Request`], reads one [`Response`], and
//! closes. Frames are length-delimited (4-byte big-endian prefix) and
//! carry JSON.
//!
//! # The connection is the lease
//!
//! There is one wrinkle on "sends one request, reads one response, and
//! closes", and it is [`Request::Attach`]: the client does not close.
//!
//! `mirage exec` borrows a session it does not own, and the run that does
//! own it must not tear the emulator daemon, the containers and the
//! scratch directory down while a borrower's workload is still using
//! them. Something therefore has to tell the run that a borrower exists,
//! and — much harder — that it has stopped existing, including when it
//! stopped by crashing.
//!
//! An explicit release message cannot do that: a borrower killed between
//! attaching and releasing would hold the session open forever. The open
//! socket can, because the kernel closes it however the client ends. So
//! the lease *is* the connection: holding it is the claim, and dropping
//! it — deliberately, or by dying — is the release. The run counts open
//! `Attach` connections and waits for the count to reach zero before
//! tearing down.
//!
//! It carries the other direction too. When the run tears down anyway —
//! the user pressed Ctrl-C rather than waiting — it closes the
//! connection, and the borrower reads that as "the session is going away"
//! and stops its own workload cleanly, instead of discovering it when the
//! container is removed out from under it.
//!
//! # Why the protocol is this small
//!
//! Because the exec'd process is not the run's child. `mirage exec` runs
//! in a different terminal from the `mirage run` that owns the session,
//! and the whole point of dropping pseudo-terminals is that a child
//! inherits the *real* terminal of whoever started it. A process spawned
//! by the run process would inherit the run's terminal, not the exec
//! client's — so the exec client spawns it itself.
//!
//! That leaves the run process with nothing to do for an exec except
//! describe the session: which containers exist, what environment the
//! emulator needs, where the rendezvous is. Everything else — spawning,
//! signalling, reaping, printing output — belongs to the process that
//! owns the terminal it is happening in.
//!
//! The previous protocol carried attach streams, stdin frames, terminal
//! resizes, exec lifecycle and a daemon handshake, because a long-lived
//! daemon owned every process and clients had to drive them at a
//! distance. None of that survives the change of ownership.
