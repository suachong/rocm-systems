//! Passive hardware discovery records and topology relationships.
//!
//! An endpoint describes hardware discovered in one generation-consistent
//! topology snapshot. It is inert: inspecting or cloning an endpoint does not
//! activate hardware, acquire an address space, or grant access to memory. An
//! activated endpoint is represented separately by `crate::device::Device`.
//!
//! Endpoint-kind variants carry only the capabilities meaningful to that kind.
//! A backend publishes a variant only when it can populate and activate that
//! endpoint faithfully; an activated device remains a separate session-owned
//! state object.
