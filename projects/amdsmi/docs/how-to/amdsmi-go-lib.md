# AMD SMI Go interface overview

The read-only Linux Go module provides GPU discovery, identity, telemetry,
current partition metadata, and ECC/RAS queries directly through CGO and
`libamd_smi`. It does not use Python, a CLI subprocess, or the legacy Go shim.
See the [standalone module guide](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/blob/develop/projects/amdsmi/go/README.md) and
[API reference](../reference/amdsmi-go-api.md).

(go_prereqs)=
## Read-only module requirements

| Build requirements | Runtime requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Linux, CGO, Go 1.20+, C compiler | AMD GPU driver and native device permissions for GPU queries |
| AMD SMI 27.1 public development header and matching shared library | Matching `libamd_smi.so`, not `libamdsmi.so` |
| Compilation and mock tests need no GPU/root | Go adds no root requirement |

Follow the [AMD SMI installation guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/amdsmi/en/latest/install/install.html)
for native dependencies. The module path is
`github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/projects/amdsmi/go`; import its `amdsmi` package:

```go
import "github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/projects/amdsmi/go/amdsmi"
```

## Build and consume the module

From the module directory, select explicit matching include and library paths:

```bash
: "${AMDSMI_INCLUDE_DIR:?Set the directory containing amd_smi/amdsmi.h}"
: "${AMDSMI_LIBRARY_DIR:?Set the directory containing the matching libamd_smi.so}"
export CGO_ENABLED=1
export CGO_CFLAGS="-I\"${AMDSMI_INCLUDE_DIR}\""
export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L\"${AMDSMI_LIBRARY_DIR}\""
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${AMDSMI_LIBRARY_DIR}${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}"
export GOTOOLCHAIN=local GOWORK=off GOPROXY=off GOSUMDB=off
go build ./...
```

Development packages install source assets under `share/amd_smi/go`, without
tests, fixtures, native binaries, or a Go toolchain in that directory. With the
native environment configured, consume checkout or installed sources from an
existing application module:

```bash
: "${AMDSMI_GO_SOURCE:?Set the checkout go directory or installed share/amd_smi/go directory}"
go mod edit -require=github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/projects/amdsmi/go@v0.0.0
go mod edit "-replace=github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/projects/amdsmi/go=${AMDSMI_GO_SOURCE}"
go build ./...
```

The local `v0.0.0` requirement is only a replacement key. For remote consumption,
pin an immutable published revision containing this module and pair it with the
native 27.1 release. Future module tags need the prefix `projects/amdsmi/go/`;
native major 27 does not determine the Go module version. Use a local
replacement for unpublished source changes.
The standalone guide gives the separate network-enabled acquisition command.

## Lifecycle and data handling

Balance every successful `amdsmi.Init()` with `amdsmi.ShutDown()`. Final package
shutdown invalidates handles even on cleanup failure; rediscover after
reinitialization. Calls are serialized within this package, but other bindings
must coordinate their native lifetime and first-initializer flags. Driver reload,
partition changes, external concurrent lifecycle calls, and hotplug recovery are
not supported while initialized.

Use `errors.Is(err, amdsmi.AMDSMI_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED)` or `errors.As` with
`*amdsmi.Error` to inspect failures. Success may still include unavailable values
or partial native data. The API reference lists field types, units, and native
limitations. The [telemetry example](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/blob/develop/projects/amdsmi/go/examples/telemetry/main.go) balances
shutdown and reports per-query failures without replacing them with zero readings.

## Legacy Go interface

The existing `goamdsmi` API and shim remain unchanged. The new module is additive,
not a source-compatible replacement; it does not include legacy CPU or setter APIs.
The following instructions apply only to the legacy interface.

```{seealso}
Refer to the [Go library API reference](../reference/amdsmi-go-api.md).
```

### Prerequisites

Before get started, make sure your environment satisfies the following prerequisites.
See the [requirements](#install_reqs) section for more information.

1. Ensure `amdgpu` drivers are installed properly for initialization. CPU APIs
   require the `amd_hsmp` kernel module. See {ref}`install_amdgpu_driver`.

2. Export `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the `amdsmi` installation directory.

   ```bash
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/rocm/lib:/opt/rocm/lib64:
   ```

3. Install Go 1.20+.

   Download Go from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/) and follow the
   official installation documentation at [Download and
   install](https://go.dev/doc/install).

   Alternatively, use a third-party utility like update-golang.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/udhos/update-golang
   cd update-golang
   sudo ./update-golang.sh
   source /etc/profile.d/golang_path.sh
   go version
   ```

### Get started

```{note}
``hipcc`` and other compilers will not automatically link in the ``libamd_smi``
dynamic library. To compile code that uses the AMD SMI library API, ensure the
``libamd_smi.so`` can be located by setting the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment
variable to the directory containing ``librocm_smi64.so`` (usually
``/opt/rocm/lib``) or by passing the ``-lamd_smi`` flag to the compiler.
```

A Go application using AMD SMI must call `goamdsmi.GO_gpu_init()` to initialize
the AMI SMI library before all other calls. This call initializes the internal
data structures required for subsequent AMD SMI operations.

`goamdsmi.GO_gpu_shutdown()` must be the last call to properly close connection to
driver and make sure that any resources held by AMD SMI are released.

### Usage

For an example on using the AMD SMI Go API, refer to this implementation
[https://github.com/amd/amd_smi_exporter/tree/master](https://github.com/amd/amd_smi_exporter/tree/master).

```{seealso}
Refer to the [Go library API reference](../reference/amdsmi-go-api.md).
```

#### Add AMD SMI library to your project

To include the AMD SMI Go API in your project, update your Makefile or Go module configuration
to fetch the appropriate version of the AMD SMI library.

```shell
# Add to go.mod
go get github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/projects/amdsmi@develop
```

Then import it:

```go
import "github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/projects/amdsmi"
```

When using a Makefile, ensure you're fetching the latest AMD SMI repository
with Go API support. See
[https://github.com/amd/amd_smi_exporter/blob/master/src/Makefile](https://github.com/amd/amd_smi_exporter/blob/master/src/Makefile)
for an example implementation.
