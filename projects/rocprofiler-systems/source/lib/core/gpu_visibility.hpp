/**
 * @brief Profiler GPU indices of the GPUs the HIP runtime exposes, in HIP ordinal order.
 *
 * Element @c k is the @c device_type_index of HIP device ordinal @c k. That is the space
 * hipFile uses to index @c per_gpu_stats (via @c hipGetDevice()). rocprofiler-sdk does
 * not store a HIP ordinal on the agent, only @c runtime_visibility.hip, so this is the
 * k-th GPU agent with @c hip_visible set, in agent-manager order. That matches HIP when
 * @c HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES / @c ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES is an increasing subset (e.g. "4,5").
 * A permutation (e.g. "5,4") or UUID list cannot be mapped without mislabeling, so this
 * returns empty and hipFile telemetry is skipped. AMD SMI GPU sampling is unaffected
 * (@c get_visible_gpu_bdfs is order-independent).
 *
 * @return Empty when no GPU agents were found (same "unknown vs none" situation as
 *         @c get_visible_gpu_bdfs returning nullopt, collapsed to "no visible GPUs"
 *         because hipFile has nothing to index), or when the visibility mask is not
 *         an increasing integer subset.
