hrr_api_args.h
--------------
One packed C struct per HIP API (both runtime and compiler dispatch tables).
All pointer/handle fields become uint64_t so the struct layout is identical on
all platforms and in the binary archive.

Struct field rules:
  * Every struct starts with:
        uint64_t thread_id;    // OS thread that made the call
        uint64_t sequence_id;  // monotonically increasing per capture session
  * Return value stored as int32_t ret (hipError_t is int, void returns skip this).
  * Pointer parameters  -> uint64_t  (GPU address or host pointer as integer)
  * Handle parameters   -> uint64_t  (hipStream_t, hipEvent_t, hipModule_t, ...)
  * dim3 parameters     -> three uint32_t fields  (e.g. gridDim_x/y/z)
  * uint3 parameters    -> three uint32_t fields
  * Scalar int/uint/... -> kept as-is (int32_t / uint32_t / ...)
  * size_t              -> uint64_t
  * float/double        -> kept as-is
  * Enum types          -> int32_t

Special extra fields appended to certain structs (after normal params):
  __hipRegisterFatBinary:
      uint64_t blob_hash_lo;  // FNV-1a-128 lo  (raw data* replaced by hash)
      uint64_t blob_hash_hi;
      uint64_t blob_size;
  hipModuleLoadData / hipModuleLoadDataEx:
      uint64_t co_hash_lo;    // code object hash
      uint64_t co_hash_hi;
      uint32_t module_id;     // sequential module handle ID
  hipMemcpy* (H2D-capable) — 1D sync/async variants:
      uint64_t blob_hash_lo;  // hash of host src data (0 if not H2D)
      uint64_t blob_hash_hi;

hip_capture_generated.cpp
--------------------------
Contains:
  * capture_hipFoo() shim for every API not in MANUAL_CAPTURE_APIS
  * hip_capture_build_table()  — installs all runtime shims
  * hip_capture_build_compiler_table() — installs all compiler shims
  * get_thread_id() helper (platform-specific)

MANUAL_CAPTURE_APIS are implemented by hand in hip_capture.cpp because they need
complex serialization (kernel launches, memcpy blob capture, module load).
The generated shims for those are simple pass-throughs — they do NOT call
write_event(); the hand-written shims do.

hip_playback_generated.cpp
---------------------------
Contains:
  * playback_hipFoo() for every HIP API
  * hrr_playback_dispatch[HRR_API_COUNT]  — indexed by hrr_api_id_t

# Dereferenced pointer arguments
#
# normalise_field_type() lowers every pointer to a uint64_t holding the
# capture-time address, so by default the pointee never reaches the archive.
# For an input struct that is silent data loss (section 8.3): replay is handed
# an address from a process that no longer exists. A Deref entry tells the
# generator to carry the pointee itself.
#
# Capture: the generated shim memcpy's `size` bytes (or `count` elements) out of
# the pointer into the event, and sets <param>_present.
# Playback: the generated handler rebuilds a local copy from those bytes and
# passes its address, instead of casting the recorded address back to a pointer.
#
# Use direction="in" for an argument the API reads, "out" for one it writes
# (recorded for fidelity; replay still passes a local, since the recorded
# address means nothing here), and "inout" for both.
#
# An API whose pointee contains device pointers, handles or nested pointers
# needs those translated at replay, which no table entry can express: give it a
# Deref for the capture side and a hand-written handler in MANUAL_PLAYBACK_APIS
# for the replay side. `playback="manual"` says so, and suppresses the generic
# reconstruction.

# addresses and array handles are rewritten at replay (ptr_members /

# graph_node_map by _HANDLE_CREATE_APIS, which is what makes a later
# dependency reference or *NodeSetParams call resolvable.

 *   blobs/<2hex>/   content-addressed raw buffers (FNV-1a-128 hash)
 *   code_objects/   .hsaco ELFs keyed by hash
 *
 * hrr_event_header fields (32 bytes, pack(1)):
 *   - event_type     uint16_t  hrr_api_id_t index
 *   - sequence_id    uint64_t  monotonically increasing per capture session
 *   - timestamp_ns   uint64_t  wall-clock at capture time
 *   - thread_id      uint64_t  OS thread that made the call (cached per thread)
 *   - payload_length uint32_t  total record size in bytes (incl. header)
 *   - reserved       uint8_t[4]  padding to 32 bytes
 *
 * Payload bytes (after the 32-byte header):
 *   - ret          int32_t (hipError_t); absent for void returns
 *   - pointer / handle types   uint64_t  (address stored as integer)
 *   - dim3 / uint3             expanded to three uint32_t _x/_y/_z fields
 *   - size_t                   uint64_t
 *   - scalars                  native C type (int32_t, uint32_t, float, ...)
 *
 * Extra fields on selected APIs (blob hashes, module_id) are appended AFTER
 * the normal parameters — see EXTRA_FIELDS in gen_hrr_api_args.py.
 *
 * Dereferenced pointer arguments (DEREF_FIELDS in gen_hrr_api_args.py) add,
 * for a pointer argument whose pointee must survive into the archive:
 *   - uint8_t  <param>_bytes[N]   the pointee's bytes, copied at capture
 *   - uint8_t  <param>_present    1 when the argument was non-null
 *   - uint32_t <param>_n          element count, for array arguments only
 * Without them a pointer argument reaches the archive as a capture-time host
 * address and nothing else, which is the payload-loss class of section 8.3.
 *
 * The structs use #pragma pack(1) so layout is identical on all platforms.

 * structs) are no longer dropped.
 * v5: hrr_api_id_t is assigned from HipDispatchTable member order, then
 * HipCompilerDispatchTable member order, instead of typedef declaration
 * order, which renumbered 496 of the 552 IDs once. Every event stores its
 * ID, so a pre-v5 archive names the wrong API when decoded against this
 * table and needs an ID translation to be read back.
 * Runtime IDs come first and compiler IDs occupy the tail, so appending a
 * HipCompilerDispatchTable member moves no existing ID, while appending a
 * HipDispatchTable member takes the first compiler ID and shifts the whole
 * compiler tail up by one. Compiler APIs do write events, so that second
 * case still needs a version bump. A retired dispatch-table slot (nulled
 * void*) still occupies an ID.
 * v6: pointer arguments whose pointee used to be dropped now carry it inline
 * (DEREF_FIELDS). Event payloads grew for ~50 APIs, so an archive written
 * before v6 cannot be read by a v6 reader: re-capture rather than replay an

# sound while the two declarations agree, and they are not required to: the
# table is append-only ABI, while hip_runtime_api.h may re-declare an API with
# a different signature under a HIP_FORCE_API_VERSION guard (hipMemAdvise gained
# a hipMemLocation parameter in HIP 8.0 this way).
