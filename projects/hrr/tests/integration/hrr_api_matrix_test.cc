/**
 * @addtogroup HRR HRR per-API playback matrix
 * @{
 * @ingroup HRRTest
 * One test per priority tier. Each captures that tier's workloads, replays the
 * archives, and asserts that every HIP API the workloads reached behaved at
 * replay the way hrr_api_matrix_expectations.h says it should.
 *
 * What is being asserted
 * ----------------------
 * Not "does replay produce the right numbers" — the roundtrip tests in
 * hrr_roundtrip_test.cc already do that. These assert the weaker but broader
 * property that an API's *replay class* has not changed: an API HRR declares a
 * no-op is still a no-op, and one it declares faithfully replayed still runs a
 * real handler. That distinction is what decides whether a recording of a real
 * workload means anything, and it is exactly the thing that can change
 * silently when the generator's classification sets are edited upstream.
 *
 * How the class is observed
 * -------------------------
 * Two independent readings of the same archive:
 *
 *   captured  the API appears in the Event Type Breakdown of
 *             `hrr-playback --info`. Without this an API the workload never
 *             managed to call is indistinguishable from one that replayed
 *             perfectly, and the matrix would report false green.
 *
 *   class     the merged stdout+stderr of a replay. NOOP handlers emit a
 *             one-time "NOOP playback handler called for <api>" warning;
 *             ERROR_STUB handlers emit a named graph-construction warning.
 *             Neither warning, plus a clean run, means a real handler ran.
 *
 * Coverage, not exhaustiveness
 * ----------------------------
 * Reaching all 551 APIs from a test binary is not achievable — some need a
 * second process, some need hardware this host does not have, some would tear
 * down the context the rest of the capture depends on. So an API a tier did
 * not reach is reported as not-exercised rather than failed, and each tier
 * instead has to clear a coverage floor. A workload that dies on its second
 * line then fails loudly, instead of reporting a clean sweep of nothing.
 *
 * Set HRR_MATRIX_RESULTS_DIR to have each tier write its observations as JSON
 * for aim-labs/scenarios/prep/hrr-api-matrix/check_matrix.py to turn into a
 * coverage report.
