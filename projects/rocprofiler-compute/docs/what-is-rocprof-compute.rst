******************************
What is ROCm Compute Profiler?
******************************

ROCm Compute Profiler is a kernel-level profiling tool for machine learning and high
performance computing (HPC) workloads running on AMD Instinct™ GPUs. It measures how
efficiently a single GPU kernel dispatch uses the underlying hardware: compute unit
occupancy, cache and memory bandwidth utilization, instruction mix, and achieved versus
peak arithmetic throughput.

This kernel-level view matters once you already know *which* kernel is worth optimizing.
Where ROCm Systems Profiler characterizes an entire application to find where time goes,
ROCm Compute Profiler drills into a specific dispatch to explain why it runs at the speed
it does, down to the hardware block level.

AMD Instinct MI-Series GPUs are data center-class GPUs designed for
compute and have some graphics capabilities disabled or removed.
ROCm Compute Profiler primarily targets use with
:doc:`GPUs in the AMD Instinct MI300, MI200, and MI100 Series <rocm:conceptual/gpu-arch>`.
Development is in progress to support Radeon™ (RDNA) GPUs.

ROCm Compute Profiler is built on top of :doc:`ROCprofiler-SDK <rocprofiler-sdk:index>` to
monitor hardware performance counters. For the full performance-model reference, see
:doc:`conceptual/performance-model`.

.. _glance-architecture:

How it works
=============

ROCm Compute Profiler is a Python-based tool that profiles an application in up to two
stages: it first replays the application as many times as needed to collect the requested
hardware counters per kernel dispatch, then, unless disabled with ``--no-roof``, runs a set
of accelerator-specific micro-benchmarks to establish the empirical roofline. The roofline
model is not available on accelerators pre-MI200. See :ref:`profiling-routine` for the exact
stage breakdown.

   :alt: Diagram of ROCm Compute Profiler replaying an application across multiple counter-collection passes, running roofline micro-benchmarks, deriving metrics, and producing analysis views available as CLI output by default, or as CSV, an analysis database, or an HTML roofline plot

Counter collection is performed by injecting two libraries into the target process alongside :doc:`ROCprofiler-SDK <rocprofiler-sdk:index>`: a native tool (``librocprofiler-compute-tool.so``) that collects hardware performance counters per dispatch, and an SDK tool (``librocprofiler-sdk-tool.so``) that handles kernel tracing and output database generation. See :ref:`core-install-rocprof-var` for the full backend and library breakdown.

.. warning::

   Because associating counters with a specific kernel dispatch requires serializing dispatches, kernels launched on separate HIP streams on the same GPU don't execute concurrently while profiling. Profiled kernel duration and utilization metrics reflect this serialized execution, not the concurrent behavior of a normal run. See the full warning and its consequences in :doc:`how-to/profile/mode`.

Once counters are collected, ROCm Compute Profiler derives higher-level metrics, such as utilizations and ratios, from the raw counter values to populate the analysis views described next.

.. _glance-cli-tools:

Key commands
==============

ROCm Compute Profiler exposes two primary modes on the ``rocprof-compute`` executable: ``profile`` to collect data, and ``analyze`` to read it back. See :ref:`modes` for the full list of modes and :ref:`basic-operations` for the required arguments per operation.

The following are key ``profile`` and ``analyze`` commands:

* To profile ``./app``, collecting all available counters for all kernels, and write results to ``workloads/my_run/<SoC>/``:

  .. code-block:: shell-session

     $ rocprof-compute profile -n my_run -- ./app

* To profile only kernels whose name matches ``vecCopy``:

  .. code-block:: shell-session

     $ rocprof-compute profile -n my_run -k vecCopy -- ./app

* To profile only the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd dispatch of each kernel:

  .. code-block:: shell-session

     $ rocprof-compute profile -n my_run -d 1 2 3 -- ./app

* To profile only the counters needed for specific analysis report blocks, which speeds up the profiling run:

  .. code-block:: shell-session

     $ rocprof-compute profile -n my_run -b 2 5 -- ./app

* To run only the roofline micro-benchmarks, skipping standard counter collection:

  .. code-block:: shell-session

     $ rocprof-compute profile -n my_run --roof-only -- ./app

* To analyze a profiled run in the terminal:

  .. code-block:: shell-session

     $ rocprof-compute analyze -p workloads/my_run/MI300X/

* To write the analysis to a SQLite analysis database instead of printing to the terminal:

  .. code-block:: shell-session

     $ rocprof-compute analyze -p workloads/my_run/MI300X/ --output-format db

* To compare two profiled runs of the same SoC side by side:

  .. code-block:: shell-session

     $ rocprof-compute analyze -p run_a/MI300X/ run_b/MI300X/

For full walkthroughs, see :doc:`how-to/profile/mode` and :doc:`how-to/analyze/cli`.

.. _glance-flags:

Flags reference
==================

ROCm Compute Profiler supports many flags for filtering kernels, dispatches, and
hardware blocks during profiling and analysis, and for selecting the analysis output
format. See :doc:`how-to/profile/mode` for the full list of profile mode flags and
:doc:`how-to/analyze/mode` for analyze mode flags, or run ``rocprof-compute profile -h``
or ``rocprof-compute analyze -h`` for the complete set.

.. _glance-output-formats:

Output formats
================

``analyze`` accepts an ``--output-format`` option for the analysis report. The following table lists the available values, plus the HTML roofline plots that ``analyze`` writes automatically, and the ``rocpd`` database that ``profile`` always writes:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Format
     - Produced by
     - Description
   * - ``rocpd``
     - profile
     - SQLite database of raw counters per dispatch, written automatically. Required for ``analyze --output-format csv`` or ``db``.
   * - ``stdout`` (default)
     - analyze
     - Analysis results printed to the terminal only.
   * - ``txt``
     - analyze
     - Analysis results written to a ``rocprof_compute_<uuid>.txt`` file.
   * - ``csv``
     - analyze
     - Analysis results written to a folder of CSV files. Requires the workload's ``rocpd`` database from profiling.
   * - ``db``
     - analyze
     - Analysis results written to a ``rocprof_compute_<uuid>.db`` SQLite analysis database. Same requirement as ``csv``.
   * - ``html``
     - analyze
     - Standalone Plotly roofline plot(s) (``empirRoof_gpu-<id>...html``), written automatically whenever the workload includes roofline data, independent of ``--output-format``. See :ref:`standalone-roofline`.

Select the analyze output format with ``--output-format`` and override the file name with ``--output-name``. See :ref:`analysis-output-format` for details.
