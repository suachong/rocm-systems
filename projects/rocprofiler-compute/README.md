# ROCm Compute Profiler

## General

ROCm Compute Profiler is a system performance profiling tool for machine
learning/HPC workloads running on AMD MI GPUs. The tool presently
targets usage on MI100, MI200, MI300, and MI350 series accelerators.

* For more information on available features, installation steps, and
workload profiling and analysis, please refer to the online
[documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-compute/en/latest/).

* Agent Skills for profiling and analyzing workloads with `rocprof-compute`
live under [skills/](skills/).

* ROCm Compute Profiler is an AMD open source tool that is part of the ROCm software stack. We welcome contributions and
feedback from the community. Please see the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for additional details on our
contribution process.

* Licensing information can be found in the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file.

## Development

ROCm Compute Profiler is now included in the rocm-systems super-repo. The latest sources are in the `develop` branch. You can find particular releases in the `release/rocm-rel-X.Y` branch for the particular release you're looking for.

### Pulling the source using sparse-checkout

Being in the super-repo, if you only want to pull the source for a particular project, do a sparse checkout:

```bash
git clone --no-checkout --filter=blob:none https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems.git
cd rocm-systems
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set projects/rocprofiler-compute
git checkout develop

cd projects/rocprofiler-compute

# Initialize submodule dependencies (vendored Python deps and src/lib/external C++ libs)
git submodule update --init --recursive -- src/

# Analyze mode dependencies only. Install these in a separate virtual environment.
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: The packages in `requirements.txt` are needed for analyze mode only; profile mode uses the standard library. Install them in a virtual environment separate from your profiled application so their pinned versions don't conflict with the workload's own packages. See the [quickstart](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-compute/en/latest/install/quickstart.html) for supported Python versions.

**Note**: When working from source, submodules live under `src/` (vendored Python dependencies like PyYAML in `src/vendored/`, and C++ libraries like googletest, fmt, and json in `src/lib/external/`). If you see import errors about missing vendored modules or missing C++ externals during a build, run `git submodule update --init --recursive -- src/`.

### Development dependencies

To install development tools (linter, pre-commit hooks, YAML utilities), run:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-development.txt
```

## Testing

Populate the <username> variable in `docker/docker-compose.therock.tarball.yml`.
Populate the <tarball_name> variable in `docker/Dockerfile.therock.tarball` (see the comment there for the naming convention and nightly index).

To quickly get the environment (bash shell) for building and testing, run the following commands:
* `cd docker`
* If the docker image is not available on the machine, then build the image, otherwise skip this step: `docker compose -f docker-compose.therock.tarball.yml build`
* Launch the container, and check the name of the container: `docker compose -f docker-compose.therock.tarball.yml up --force-recreate -d `
* Run bash shell on the launched container: `docker exec -it <container_name> bash`
* If testing is done, kill the container: `docker container kill <container_name>`

Inside the docker container, clean, build, then install the project with tests enabled:
```
rm -rf build install && cmake -B build -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install -D ENABLE_TESTS=ON -D INSTALL_TESTS=ON -D ENABLE_COVERAGE=ON -S . && cmake --build build --target install --parallel 8
```

Common CMake options:
- `-D ENABLE_TESTS=ON` - Enable building test executables
- `-D INSTALL_TESTS=ON` - Install test files and test suite
- `-D ENABLE_COVERAGE=ON` - Enable code coverage reporting
- `-D TEST_FROM_INSTALL=ON` - Enable testing from installation directory instead of build directory
- `-D ENABLE_SANITIZER=ASAN|HOST_ASAN|TSAN` - Build with sanitizer instrumentation for development (default OFF)

Note that per the above command, build assets will be stored under `build` directory and installed assets will be stored under `install` directory.

Then, to run the automated test suite, run the following commands:
```
cd build
ctest
```

For manual testing, you can find the executable at `install/bin/rocprof-compute`
