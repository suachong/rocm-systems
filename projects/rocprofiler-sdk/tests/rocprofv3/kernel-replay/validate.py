# Validates multi-pass kernel-replay counter collection (JSON output) produced by:
#   rocprofv3 --pmc <grp0> --pmc <grp1> ... --replay-mode kernel --kernel-replay-beta-enabled -- kernel-replay
# where each --pmc group shares the same sanity counters (SQ_WAVES, SQ_INSTS_VALU) plus one unique
# counter. The number of groups drives the number of replay passes.
#
# Key validation metrics:
#   1. Every dispatch is replayed exactly N times (replay_pass 0..N-1, one per --pmc group).
#   2. The shared sanity counters are CONSTANT across a given kernel's replay passes -- the
#      determinism snapshot/restore guarantees (each pass runs against identical inputs).
#   3. Each pass collects a DISTINCT batch (the unique counters differ pass-to-pass), proving real
#      multi-pass rather than one repeated batch.
#   4. Counters differ between the three kernels (vecAdd / saxpy / vecScale), so they are real
#      per-dispatch measurements, not a constant artifact.
#   5. dispatch_id identity: a replayed dispatch keeps ONE dispatch_id across its passes (only the
#      replay_pass index advances), and dispatch_id increments sequentially across dispatches -- one
#      id minted per logical dispatch, reused by every pass (never one id per pass).
# (The app verifies its own results in the generate step, guarding the restored data itself.)
