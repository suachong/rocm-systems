Generate one translation unit per (type, redop) instantiation of
ncclCeLocalReduceKernelVec.

Previously all instantiations lived in a single ce_reduce.cc, which meant
the device linker paid for all of them in one single-threaded LLVM bitcode
link + O3 codegen pass (ld.lld). Two of those 40 kernels -- int8_t/uint8_t
Min and Max -- balloon to ~56K instructions each (vs ~5-6K for Sum/Prod on
the same types) because the compiler can't vectorize a byte-granularity
compare-select the way it does packed add/mul, and that alone made the whole
TU take ~48 minutes to compile. Splitting into one file per instantiation
lets ninja build them in parallel like every other device TU, bounding the
wall-clock cost by the slowest single kernel instead of the sum of all 40.

Output: one ce_reduce_impl.h (shared VecTrait/ReduceOp/kernel-template
definitions) plus one ce_reduce_<type>_<redop>.cpp per instantiation, each
defining a small host-callable launcher that ce_reduce.cc's dispatcher calls
into. The .cpp extension is intentional: it matches the existing
gensrc/*.cpp filter in src/CMakeLists.txt so these files are automatically
included in the non-device-linker (RDC) build and automatically excluded
(compiled separately by cmake/DeviceLinker.cmake instead) in the
device-linker build, with no additional filter rules needed.

The actual C++/HIP code lives in ce_reduce_impl.h.in (copied verbatim) and
ce_reduce_launcher.cpp.in (a string.Template with $tag/$ctype/$redname/
$redval/$vec_define placeholders) alongside this script, not inlined here,
so it reads and edits like normal device code.
